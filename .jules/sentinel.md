## 2025-02-14 - Add allow-secret-comptime config to strictness
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded secrets check (`contains_secret_literal`) printed a warning but could not be silenced because the configuration property `allow_secret_comptime` was missing.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secret checks that produce false positives can train users to ignore security warnings if there is no way to suppress them.
**Prevention:** Implement the suppression configuration knob to allow users to document and silence expected findings.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Improve secret detection bounding logic
**Vulnerability:** The secret detection logic in `tyc-analyse` and `tyc build` only matched variable names that *ended* with secret suffixes (e.g., `_KEY`), missing embedded secrets (`API_KEY_FOO`) and camelCase secrets (`myTokenValue`).
**Learning:** Simple `ends_with` string matching is insufficient for static analysis security checks; boundary conditions (string edges, underscores, and casing transitions) must be evaluated to prevent false negatives without introducing false positives like `MONKEY`.
**Prevention:** Always use proper token boundary evaluation (checking adjacent characters for delimiters or case transitions) when scanning for secret keywords within identifiers.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Ensure all permutations of high-risk security keywords are explicitly registered
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded secrets check (`contains_secret_literal`) failed to detect `APIKEY` as a secret, despite catching `API_KEY` and similar variations.
**Learning:** Case-boundary heuristics and substring matching logic may miss fully capitalized squashed acronyms like `APIKEY` if they are not explicitly registered as standalone keywords, leading to potential false negatives for common secret variable names.
**Prevention:** When updating or adding to the `tyc::contains_secret_literal` diagnostic (e.g., in `is_secret_name` or `secret_suffix`), explicitly register all common permutations of high-risk security keywords (like `APIKEY` and `API_KEY`), as boundary heuristics cannot be fully relied upon to catch all variations.

## 2025-02-14 - Ensure all permutations of high-risk security keywords are explicitly registered
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded secrets check (`contains_secret_literal`) failed to detect `APITOKEN` and `APISECRET` as secrets, despite catching `API_KEY` and similar variations.
**Learning:** Case-boundary heuristics and substring matching logic may miss fully capitalized squashed acronyms like `APITOKEN` if they are not explicitly registered as standalone keywords, leading to potential false negatives for common secret variable names.
**Prevention:** When updating or adding to the `tyc::contains_secret_literal` diagnostic (e.g., in `is_secret_name` or `secret_suffix`), explicitly register all common permutations of high-risk security keywords (like `API_TOKEN` and `APITOKEN`), as boundary heuristics cannot be fully relied upon to catch all variations.

## 2024-05-24 - Synchronized Secret Scanning Heuristics
**Vulnerability:** A minor discrepancy existed between the `is_secret_name` heuristic dictionary in `tyc-analyse` and `secret_suffix` in the `tyc` build tools, specifically missing the keyword `"PASS"`.
**Learning:** This discrepancy could have allowed a variable like `DB_PASS` to be flagged in one context but silently ignored in another, creating a confusing and potentially leaky security gap.
**Prevention:** Always ensure that heuristic logic, such as dictionaries or regexes used across multiple crates or commands in a workspace, are either shared as a common library constant or strictly synchronized to maintain consistent security enforcement.

## 2026-07-04 - Longest-first Matching for Secret Detection
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded secret detection was missing `APIKEY` due to partial overlap with `KEY` because `KEY` was evaluated before `APIKEY`.
**Learning:** When scanning for secrets using keyword arrays, substrings (like `KEY`) must be placed after longer matches (like `APIKEY` or `API_KEY`) to prevent premature partial matches.
**Prevention:** Always maintain hardcoded secret matching keywords in longest-first order.

## 2025-02-14 - Improve Secret Detection at Numeric Boundaries and Case Junctions
**Vulnerability:** The secret detection logic (`is_secret_name` and `secret_suffix`) correctly checked for string boundaries and basic camelCase junctions, but it failed on numeric boundaries (e.g. `123PASSWORD` or `myPASSWORD123`) and transitions from UPPER to TitleCase (e.g. `dbPASSWORDString` where `PASSWORD` is followed by `String`).
**Learning:** Checking character casings before and after a keyword is tricky. Specifically, digits are neither uppercase nor lowercase ASCII characters, so relying solely on casing checks to identify word boundaries causes embedded numeric boundaries to fail. Furthermore, the TitleCase junction requires checking two characters ahead to verify it's the start of a new word rather than just the end of an acronym.
**Prevention:** Always include `is_ascii_digit()` checks when evaluating substring boundaries for embedded secret keywords, and account for TitleCase transitions (an uppercase character followed by a lowercase character) at the end of the matched keyword. Both `tyc-analyse` and `tyc` build crates must be updated simultaneously.

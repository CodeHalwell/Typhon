## 2025-02-14 - Add allow-secret-comptime config to strictness
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded secrets check (`contains_secret_literal`) printed a warning but could not be silenced because the configuration property `allow_secret_comptime` was missing.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secret checks that produce false positives can train users to ignore security warnings if there is no way to suppress them.
**Prevention:** Implement the suppression configuration knob to allow users to document and silence expected findings.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Improve secret detection bounding logic
**Vulnerability:** The secret detection logic in `tyc-analyse` and `tyc build` only matched variable names that *ended* with secret suffixes (e.g., `_KEY`), missing embedded secrets (`API_KEY_FOO`) and camelCase secrets (`myTokenValue`).
**Learning:** Simple `ends_with` string matching is insufficient for static analysis security checks; boundary conditions (string edges, underscores, and casing transitions) must be evaluated to prevent false negatives without introducing false positives like `MONKEY`.
**Prevention:** Always use proper token boundary evaluation (checking adjacent characters for delimiters or case transitions) when scanning for secret keywords within identifiers.

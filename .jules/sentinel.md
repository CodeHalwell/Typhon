## 2025-02-14 - Add allow-secret-comptime config to strictness
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded secrets check (`contains_secret_literal`) printed a warning but could not be silenced because the configuration property `allow_secret_comptime` was missing.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secret checks that produce false positives can train users to ignore security warnings if there is no way to suppress them.
**Prevention:** Implement the suppression configuration knob to allow users to document and silence expected findings.
